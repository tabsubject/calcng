        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What is a Carburetor?</h2>
          <p>
            A carburetor is a mechanical device designed to blend air and fuel in the precise proportions needed for efficient combustion in an internal combustion engine. Operating on fundamental physics principles, it creates the optimal air-fuel mixture under varying engine conditions, from idle to full throttle operation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The primary function of a carburetor extends beyond simple mixing. It must deliver the right fuel-to-air ratio for different operating conditions: a rich mixture (more fuel) for cold starts and acceleration, and a leaner mixture (less fuel) for cruising and fuel economy. This adaptability makes carburetors remarkably sophisticated despite their mechanical simplicity.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Physics Behind Carburetor Operation</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Bernoulli's Principle and the Venturi Effect</h3>
          <p>
            The fundamental operation of carburetors relies on Bernoulli's principle and the Venturi effect, where air flowing through a restriction increases in speed and decreases in pressure. This pressure differential is what draws fuel from the float chamber into the airstream.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the engine's intake stroke creates suction, air rushes through the carburetor's venturi tube. The narrowed section accelerates the airflow, reducing static pressure at that point. This low-pressure area allows atmospheric pressure in the float bowl to push fuel through the main jet into the venturi, where it atomizes and mixes with the incoming air.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Air-Fuel Ratio Dynamics</h3>
          <p>
            The stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for gasoline is approximately 14.7:1 by weight, meaning 14.7 parts air to 1 part fuel for complete combustion. However, engines require different ratios depending on operating conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cold starting</strong>: 2:1 to 8:1 (very rich mixture)</li>
            <li><strong>Idle</strong>: 12:1 to 13:1 (slightly rich)</li>
            <li><strong>Cruising</strong>: 15:1 to 16:1 (lean for economy)</li>
            <li><strong>Full power</strong>: 12:1 to 13:1 (rich for maximum power)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Essential Components of a Carburetor</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Float Chamber System</h3>
          <p>
            The float chamber serves as the carburetor's fuel reservoir, maintaining a constant fuel level through a float-operated needle valve. As fuel enters the chamber, the float rises until it closes the needle valve, stopping fuel flow. When fuel is consumed, the float drops, reopening the valve to maintain the correct level.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Venturi and Main Jet Assembly</h3>
          <p>
            The venturi is the carburetor's heart, creating the pressure differential necessary for fuel delivery. The main jet, precisely calibrated for the engine's requirements, controls fuel flow into the venturi. Different jet sizes accommodate various engine configurations and performance requirements.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Throttle Valve and Butterfly</h3>
          <p>
            The throttle valve, often called a butterfly valve due to its shape, controls airflow through the carburetor. Connected to the accelerator pedal or throttle cable, it regulates engine speed and power output by varying the air-fuel mixture volume entering the engine.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Choke System</h3>
          <p>
            The choke enriches the mixture for cold starting by restricting airflow, creating higher vacuum and drawing more fuel. Modern carburetors often feature automatic chokes using bimetallic springs or electric heating elements that gradually open as the engine warms.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Accelerator Pump</h3>
          <p>
            This component provides an immediate fuel boost during rapid throttle opening, preventing hesitation or stumbling during acceleration. A diaphragm or piston pump shoots extra fuel into the venturi when the throttle opens quickly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Types of Carburetors by Design</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Updraft Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            In updraft designs, air enters at the bottom and flows upward through the venturi. The working principle relies on pressure differences, with fuel sucked into the venturi and regulated by air velocity. These were common in early automotive applications but are rarely used today due to fuel puddling issues.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Downdraft Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            Downdraft carburetors have air entering from the top, flowing downward through the venturi. This design prevents fuel puddling and provides better fuel distribution, making it the preferred choice for most automotive applications. The downward airflow assists in fuel atomization and mixture delivery to the cylinders.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Horizontal Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            In horizontal carburetors, air enters at one end and flows horizontally through the carburetor, mixing with fuel to create the air-fuel mixture before entering the engine cylinder. These are commonly used in small engines, chainsaws, and some motorcycle applications where space constraints favor this orientation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Types of Carburetors by Barrel Configuration</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Single-Barrel Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            Single-barrel carburetors feature one venturi and are typically used on smaller engines or economy vehicles. They're simple, cost-effective, and adequate for engines not requiring high performance. The single throat handles all engine operating conditions through various circuits and systems.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Two-Barrel Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            Two-barrel carburetors can operate as either progressive or simultaneous systems. In progressive operation, the primary barrel handles idle and low-speed operation, while the secondary opens at higher throttle positions. Simultaneous operation has both barrels opening together, providing greater airflow capacity.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Four-Barrel Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            Four-barrel carburetors typically feature two primary and two secondary barrels. The primaries handle normal driving conditions, while the secondaries provide additional airflow for high-performance operation. These complex systems require precise tuning but can deliver excellent performance across a wide operating range.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Specialized Carburetor Types</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Float-Type Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            Float-type carburetors use a reliable float mechanism to maintain consistent fuel levels, making them suitable for most stationary and automotive applications. The float chamber provides steady fuel delivery regardless of fuel tank level variations.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Diaphragm Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            Diaphragm carburetors are essential components in various machines, serving a crucial role in fuel delivery and combustion processes. These carburetors use a flexible diaphragm instead of a float to regulate fuel flow, making them ideal for handheld equipment that operates in various orientations.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Constant Velocity (CV) Carburetors</h3>
          <p>
            CV carburetors use a vacuum-operated piston or diaphragm to automatically adjust the venturi size based on engine demand. This design provides smooth throttle response and good fuel economy by maintaining optimal air velocity through the venturi across different operating conditions.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Carburetor Problems and Symptoms</h2>

          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Fuel System Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure proper carburetor performance, regularly replace the fuel filter to prevent clogs and maintain fuel flow, and check the fuel pressure regulator to ensure it is within the recommended range. Poor fuel quality significantly affects carburetor performance and longevity.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Diagnostic Approach</h3>
          <p>
            A quick diagnostic test involves shooting a one-second burst of carburetor cleaner down the throat of the carburetor and pulling the starter cord - if the engine runs briefly and dies, you have a fuel problem. This simple test can quickly identify fuel delivery issues.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Systematic Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>
            Begin troubleshooting with external factors: fuel supply, ignition system, and engine mechanical condition. Many carburetor problems are actually caused by issues elsewhere in the system. Check vacuum lines, gaskets, and mounting for air leaks that can cause poor performance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Common Fixes</h3>
          <p>
            Most carburetor problems resolve through cleaning, proper adjustment, and replacement of worn components like gaskets and diaphragms. If your engine only runs smoothly with the choke engaged, you're likely dealing with a carburetor issue that requires attention to the idle circuit or air leaks.
          </p>
