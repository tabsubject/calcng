          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Maintain Optimal Speed</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most effective ways to reduce fuel consumption is maintaining an appropriate speed. A steady 50-90 km/h (31-56 mph) on the highway is best to achieve optimal fuel economy. Here's how speed affects your fuel consumption:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Highway Speed Management:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintain consistent speeds between 45-55 mph for maximum efficiency</li>
            <li>Use cruise control on highways to avoid speed fluctuations</li>
            <li>Every 5 mph above 50 mph is equivalent to paying an additional $0.18 per gallon</li>
            <li>Aggressive driving can lower fuel economy by 15-30% at highway speeds</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>City Driving Optimization:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anticipate traffic flow to avoid unnecessary acceleration and braking</li>
            <li>Maintain steady speeds in stop-and-go traffic</li>
            <li>Use gradual acceleration rather than rapid starts</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Smooth Acceleration and Braking</h3>
          <p>
            Avoid revving your accelerator to a high revolutions per minute (RPM). It's better for fuel economy, as your engine uses less fuel when it is revolving slower, at a lower RPM.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Best Practices for Acceleration:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accelerate gradually and smoothly from stops</li>
            <li>Shift to higher gears as soon as possible (manual transmission)</li>
            <li>Keep RPMs below 3,000 during normal driving</li>
            <li>Use gentle throttle inputs rather than sudden acceleration</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Efficient Braking Techniques:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anticipate stops and coast to decelerate naturally</li>
            <li>Use engine braking when going downhill</li>
            <li>Avoid riding the brakes in traffic</li>
            <li>Plan your approach to red lights and stop signs</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Reduce Idling Time</h3>
          <p>
            Excessive idling wastes fuel without providing any miles traveled. Modern engines don't require extensive warm-up periods, and idling for more than 30 seconds uses more fuel than restarting your engine.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Strategies to Minimize Idling:</strong>
          </p>

            <li>Park in shade during summer to reduce air conditioning needs</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Plan and Combine Trips</h3>
          <p>
            Efficient trip planning can significantly reduce your overall fuel consumption:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Trip Planning Strategies:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Combine multiple errands into one trip</li>
            <li>Plan routes to avoid heavy traffic and construction zones</li>
            <li>Use navigation apps to find the most fuel-efficient routes</li>
            <li>Consider carpooling or public transportation for longer trips</li>
            <li>Choose off-peak hours when possible to avoid stop-and-go traffic</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Use the pressure recommended in your owner's manual or door jamb sticker</li>
            <li>Check pressure when tires are cold (before driving)</li>
            <li>Don't forget to check your spare tire</li>
            <li>Consider nitrogen inflation for more stable pressure</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Signs of Improper Tire Pressure:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uneven tread wear patterns</li>
            <li>Reduced handling and braking performance</li>
            <li>Increased road noise</li>
